# CSI4106-HandwrittenDigitClassification

# Project Description

PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras are the three selected open-source software for building an elementary convolutional neural network.

# Summary of Approach
The chosen approach for the software comparison between PyTorch, TensorFlow and Keras is to have the three framework trained to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.
Choosing to use the MNIST dataset is suitable in terms of this context because training the classifier on the dataset is considered the “hello world” of image recognition.
When doing software comparison in terms of speed, flexibility and other essential attributes of artificial intelligence libraries, having such a common, versatile dataset would guarantee the execution and allow a robust benchmark to perform the comparison.
